# FriendFinder TODO




SHOULD SURVEY SUBMISSION BE SAVING ANYTHING TO friends.js?
Right now, all submissions are being saved to the server and are lost as soon as the server restarts

api/friends link at the bottom of each page is not working correctly

I think these two problems are related...






-Get the modal popup to display correctly (with picture and name, correctly matched)
